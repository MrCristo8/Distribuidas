# Distributed Applications project

## Overview

This project was proposed by one of our teachers, to learn about n-layer architecture, using all Java EE technologies.

## What it contains

Mainly 3 branches, one for each partial, we had to make 3 times the same project, as the requirements for the database persistance and front end frameworks changed.

## Disclaimer

This project in my opinion was made on a rush, as university life does not allow you to have any time to implement everything you want, but in the end, the third branch was the charm, it is safe to say that the project was completed, finally.
